# mathlib-import-graph
An interactive viewer for the mathlib import graph.

Features added to [Eric Wieser's original](https://github.com/eric-wieser/mathlib-import-graph):

- `index.html` declares
    ```
    const HIDDEN_AREAS = ['core', 'init', ...];
    ```
    to hide the specified areas.
- One can hide further areas by clicking on the keys below the graph. Bold indicates that an area is selected and normal font indicates that an area is hidden.
